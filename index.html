            <h2>All About Organic Farming</h2>
            <p align="justify"><br> Let’s talk about organic farming. This is an agricultural system that utilizes green
                manure,
                compost,
                biological pest control and crop rotation to produce crops, livestock and poultry. It’s a system
                that
                cultivates resources to conserve biodiversity and support ecological balance. Some of the primary
                aspects of
                organic farming are to augment the soil’s biological activity, enhance the fertility of the soil,
                and
                use
                green manure, cover crops, animal manure, and soil rotation to disturb the habitation of pests and
                diseases.
                Synthetic chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, herbicides or pesticides aren’t used in organic
                farming.
                The
                goal within organic farming is to manage agricultural production in the best natural way. Organic
                farming
                contributes added protection to the soil which in turn is crucial for exceptional productivity.<br></p>

            <h2>Why Farm Organically?</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                The main reasons farmers state for wanting to farm organically are their concerns for the environment
                and about working with agricultural chemicals in conventional farming systems. There is also an issue
                with the amount of energy used in agriculture, since many farm chemicals require energy intensive
                manufacturing processes that rely heavily on fossil fuels. Organic farmers find their method of farming
                to be profitable and personally rewarding.<br><br>Organic farming is a method of crop and livestock
                production
                that involves much more than choosing not to
                use
                pesticides, fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.
                Organic farming promotes the use of crop rotations and cover crops, and encourages balanced
                host/predator
                relationships. Organic residues and nutrients produced on the farm are recycled back to the soil. Cover
                crops and composted manure are used to maintain soil organic matter and fertility. Preventative insect
                and
                disease control methods are practiced, including crop rotation, improved genetics and resistant
                varieties.
                Integrated pest and weed management, and soil conservation systems are valuable tools on an organic
                farm.
                Organically approved pesticides include "natural" or other pest management products included in the
                Permitted Substances List (PSL) of the organic standards. The Permitted Substances List identifies
                substances permitted for use as a pesticides in organic agriculture. All grains, forages and protein
                supplements fed to livestock must be organically grown.<br> </p>

            <p align="justify">1. Crop Diversity: Now a days a new practice has come into picture which is called
                -Polyculture- in which a
                variety of crops can be cultivated simultaneously just to meet the increasing demand of crops. Unlike
                the
                ancient practice which was -Monoculture- in which only one type of crop was cultivated in a particular
                location.<br><br>2. Soil Management: After the cultivation of crops, the soil loses its nutrients and
                its
                quality depletes. Organic agriculture initiates the use of natural ways to increase the health of soil.
                It
                focuses on the use of bacteria that is present in animal waste which helps in making the soil nutrients
                more
                productive to enhance the soil.<br><br>3. Weed Management: -Weed-, is the unwanted plant that grows in
                agricultural
                fields. Organic agriculture pressurizes on lowering the weed rather than removing it
                completely.<br><br>4.
                Controlling other organisms: There are both useful and harmful organisms in the agricultural farm which
                affect the field. The growth of such organisms needs to be controlled to protect the soil and the crops.
                This can be done by the use of herbicides and pesticides that contain less chemicals or are natural.
                Also,
                proper sanitization of the entire farm should be maintained to control other organisms.<br><br>5.
                Livestock:
                Organic
                farming instigates domestic animals use to increase the sustainability of the farm.<br><br>6. Genetic
                Modification:
                Genetic modification is kept away from this kind of agricultural set up because organic farming focuses
                on
                the use of natural ways and discourages engineered animals and plants.</p>
